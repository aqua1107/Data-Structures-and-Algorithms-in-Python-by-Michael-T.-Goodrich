# Medical Device Software 
Software in medical equipment such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and MRI machines must operate flawlessly to ensure patient safety.<br>
Any software malfunction could lead to incorrect diagnoses, improper treatment, or even fatal consequences.<br>

# Aviation Control Systems 
Air traffic control software and onboard flight control systems (such as the Flight Management System and Autopilot) ensure safe navigation and operation of aircraft.<br>
Software failures in these systems could lead to mid-air collisions or crashes.<br>

# Nuclear Power Plant Control Systems 
The software controlling nuclear reactors must precisely regulate operations to prevent catastrophic failures,<br>
such as reactor meltdowns or radiation leaks. Safety mechanisms rely on real-time software monitoring and automated emergency responses.
